# Specify the default remote user; this will apply if not overridden in inventory

# The remote_user is set to admin, which matches your usage in inventory.ini. This will apply to hosts in the inventory that do not specify a different user.

# Specify the default Python interpreter (if needed)

# SSH key management
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa #~/.ssh/ansible  # Specify the private key for SSH authentication
# I added the private_key_file setting explicitly in the [defaults] section, so it applies to all SSH connections unless overridden by host-specific configurations in inventory.ini.

# Disable host key checking for ease of testing; be cautious in production
host_key_checking = false
# The host_key_checking setting is included to simplify testing. Disabling host key checking can help avoid SSH connection issues during development but is not recommended for production environments due to security concerns.

# If you have multiple users or configurations, you can override in the inventory file
